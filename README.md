# JQuery Film

# Brief

- Use the global array testData to render something in the test div below.<br>
- Demonstrate mobile/tablet/desktop responsive design and some user interactivity.<br>
- The test data does include a Vimeo ID for each trailer, but we are not expecting you to use it.<br>
- Use whatever library/framework you feel comfortable with.<br>

# Solution

A responsive grid of film posters which reveals more information on mouseover.

## Expanding this project in the future

How would I improve this project if I had more time?

- Hook up to an API
- GSAP animations
- More sophisticated text scaling on mobile devices
- Masonry layout for cards rather than wrapped rows
- Guard causes on data
- Lazy loading
- Add button to load modal of trailer to each card
