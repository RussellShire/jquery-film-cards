## Expanding this project in the future

How would I improve this project if I had more time?

- Hook up to IMDB API
- GSAP animations
- More sophisticated text scaling on mobile devices
- Masonry layout for cards rather than wrapped rows
- Guard causes on incoming data, not presently needed as data was checked beforehand
- Add button to load modal of trailer to each card

## Usage

Tested and working November 2022 on jQuery 3.6.0
